2020-12-04	Evaluating Audio Descriptionand BPS VisitorExperience in Titanic Belfast	Journal of Audio-visual Translation	"This   paper   presents   the   results   of   a   study   that   evaluates   audio description  (AD)  and  visitor  experience  with  a  group  of  blind  and partially sighted (BPS) visitors to a real-world visitor attraction—Titanic Belfast. We apply the 10-facet model ofvisitor experience of Packer and Ballantyne  (2016) for  the  first  time  in  the  context  of  accessibility,  and through  this  we  highlight  accessibility  issues  which  arose  during  the study.  We  identify  two  categories  in  our  qualitative  analysis  that  the model  (Packer  &  Ballantyne,  2016)  cannot  cover.  We  also  model  the factors  that  influence  visitor  experience  and  apply  them  to  the  later approach of Packer, Ballantyne, & Bond’s (2018) Dimensions of Visitor Experience  (DoVE)  Adjective  Checklist.The checklist  is  based  on  their previous    10-facet    model,and   translated    and    refined    into    15 dimensions. Although the DoVE checklist is notspecifically designed for the    context    of    accessibility,    we    found    that    it    is    sufficiently comprehensive  to  model  accessibilityaspects  of  the  museum  AD  and visitor experience for BPS visitors."

2021-08-10	"Stories, journeys and smart maps: an approach to universal access"	Universal Access in the Information Society	"This paper proposes a new approach to universal access based on the premise that humans have the universal capacity to engage emotionally with a story, whatever their ability. Our approach is to present the �story� of museum resources and knowledge as a journey, and then represent this journey physically as a smart map. The key research question is to assess the extent to which our �story� to journey to smart map� (SJSM) approach provides emotional engagement as part of the museum experience. This approach is applied through the creation of a smart map for blind and partially sighted (BPS) visitors. Made in partnership with Titanic Belfast, a world-leading tourist attraction, the interactive map tells the story of Titanic�s maiden voyage. The smart map uses low-cost technologies such as laser-cut map features and software-controlled multi-function buttons for the audio description (AD). The AD is enhanced with background effects, dramatized personal stories and the ship�s last messages. The results of a reception study show that the approach enabled BPS participants to experience significant emotional engagement with museum resources. The smart model also gave BPS users a level of control over the AD which gave them a greater sense of empowerment and independence, which is particularly important for BPS visitors with varying sight conditions. We conclude that our SJSM approach has considerable potential as an approach to universal access, and to increase emotional engagement with museum collections. We also propose several developments which could further extend the approach and its implementation."	"Wang, X., Crookes, D., Harding, S., & Johnston, D. (2021).
